I want to learn JavaScript because it's essential for me to enhance my skills. 
Whether it's for my internship or future projects, JavaScript will be incredibly useful. 
JavaScript is perfect for creating dynamic and interactive webpages. 
I love that it works both on the frontend with React and on the backend with Node.js. 
Plus, its cross-browser compatibility makes it easy to run on any browser.
